# 22. `object-fit` in CSS

## Quick Revision

The **`object-fit`** CSS property specifies how the content of a replaced element (like `<img>`, `<video>`, `<canvas>`, `<iframe>`) should be resized to fit its container. It works similarly to the `background-size` property for background images, but for the actual content of the element.

Common values include:

*   **`fill`:** The content is resized to fill the element's box. The aspect ratio is not preserved.
*   **`contain`:** The content is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting within the element's content box. The entire object will be visible.
*   **`cover`:** The content is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while filling the element's entire content box. The object will be clipped to fit.
*   **`none`:** The content is not resized.
*   **`scale-down`:** The content is sized as if `none` or `contain` were specified, whichever would result in a smaller concrete object size.

## Detailed Explanation

`object-fit` is incredibly useful for controlling how images and videos behave within their designated space, especially in responsive designs, without distorting their aspect ratio or leaving unwanted empty space.

### Why `object-fit`?

Before `object-fit`, achieving responsive images that filled their containers without distortion often required complex CSS hacks or JavaScript. `object-fit` provides a simple and elegant solution.

### How it Works

`object-fit` applies to **replaced elements**. These are elements whose content is not directly rendered by the CSS engine but is an external resource (like an image or video).

It dictates how the element's content box should be filled by the content, considering the content's intrinsic aspect ratio and the element's aspect ratio.

## Code Examples

### HTML Structure

```html
<div class="image-container">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x200" alt="Placeholder Image" class="object-fill">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x200" alt="Placeholder Image" class="object-contain">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x200" alt="Placeholder Image" class="object-cover">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x200" alt="Placeholder Image" class="object-none">
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x200" alt="Placeholder Image" class="object-scale-down">
</div>

<style>
  .image-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    gap: 20px;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
  }

  .image-container img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 150px; /* Fixed height for demonstration */
    border: 2px solid #333;
    background-color: #ccc;
  }

  .object-fill {
    object-fit: fill;
  }
  .object-contain {
    object-fit: contain;
  }
  .object-cover {
    object-fit: cover;
  }
  .object-none {
    object-fit: none;
  }
  .object-scale-down {
    object-fit: scale-down;
  }
</style>
```

**Explanation of `object-fit` values with a 400x200 image in a 100% width, 150px height container:**

*   **`fill`:** The image will stretch to fill the 100% width and 150px height, distorting its aspect ratio.
*   **`contain`:** The image will scale down to fit entirely within the 100% width and 150px height, maintaining its aspect ratio. There might be empty space (letterboxing or pillarboxing).
*   **`cover`:** The image will scale up or down to fill the entire 100% width and 150px height, maintaining its aspect ratio. Parts of the image might be clipped.
*   **`none`:** The image will retain its original size (400x200px) and will be clipped if it's larger than the container.
*   **`scale-down`:** The image will behave like `none` if it's smaller than the container, and like `contain` if it's larger.
