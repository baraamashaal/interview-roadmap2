# 1. Positioning Types in CSS

## Quick Revision

CSS `position` property controls how an element is positioned on a web page. Understanding its different values is fundamental for layout and design.

*   **`static`:** The default positioning. Elements render in their normal flow.
*   **`relative`:** Positioned relative to its normal position. Leaves a gap where it would normally be.
*   **`absolute`:** Positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. Removed from the normal flow.
*   **`fixed`:** Positioned relative to the viewport. Removed from the normal flow.
*   **`sticky`:** Positioned based on the user's scroll position. Behaves like `relative` until a scroll threshold is met, then becomes `fixed`.

## Detailed Explanation

The `position` property is used in conjunction with `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties to precisely control an element's placement.

### 1. `position: static`

*   **Behavior:** Elements are rendered in order, as they appear in the document flow.
*   **`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`:** These properties have no effect on `static` positioned elements.
*   **Default:** This is the default value for all HTML elements.

### 2. `position: relative`

*   **Behavior:** An element with `position: relative` is positioned relative to its normal position. It still occupies its original space in the document flow.
*   **`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`:** These properties shift the element from its normal position.
*   **Use Case:** Often used as a positioning context for absolutely positioned child elements.

### 3. `position: absolute`

*   **Behavior:** An element with `position: absolute` is removed from the normal document flow. It is positioned relative to its nearest **positioned ancestor** (an ancestor with `position` other than `static`). If no positioned ancestor is found, it's positioned relative to the initial containing block (the `<html>` element).
*   **`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`:** These properties define the offset from the edges of its containing block.
*   **Use Case:** Creating overlays, tooltips, dropdowns, or placing elements precisely without affecting the surrounding layout.

### 4. `position: fixed`

*   **Behavior:** An element with `position: fixed` is removed from the normal document flow. It is positioned relative to the **viewport**, meaning it stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
*   **`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`:** These properties define the offset from the edges of the viewport.
*   **Use Case:** Creating sticky headers, footers, or sidebars that remain visible as the user scrolls.

### 5. `position: sticky`

*   **Behavior:** An element with `position: sticky` is positioned based on the user's scroll position. It behaves like `position: relative` until its containing block crosses a specified threshold, at which point it becomes `position: fixed`.
*   **`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`:** At least one of these properties must be specified for `sticky` to work.
*   **Use Case:** Creating sticky navigation bars, table headers, or sidebars that stick to the top of the viewport when scrolled past.

## Code Examples

### `position: relative`

```html
<div class="static-box">Static Box</div>
<div class="relative-box">Relative Box</div>
<div class="static-box">Static Box</div>

<style>
  .static-box {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: lightblue;
    margin: 10px;
    border: 1px solid blue;
  }
  .relative-box {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: lightgreen;
    margin: 10px;
    border: 1px solid green;
    position: relative;
    top: 20px;
    left: 20px; /* Shifts 20px down and 20px right from its normal position */
  }
</style>
```

### `position: absolute`

```html
<div class="parent-relative">
  Parent (relative)
  <div class="child-absolute">Child (absolute)</div>
</div>

<style>
  .parent-relative {
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: lightcoral;
    margin: 50px;
    border: 1px solid red;
    position: relative; /* This makes it the positioning context */
  }
  .child-absolute {
    width: 80px;
    height: 80px;
    background-color: lightgoldenrodyellow;
    border: 1px solid orange;
    position: absolute;
    top: 10px;
    right: 10px;
  }
</style>
```

### `position: fixed`

```html
<div class="fixed-header">Fixed Header</div>
<div style="height: 1500px;">Scroll down to see fixed header stay.</div>

<style>
  .fixed-header {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: #333;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px;
    text-align: center;
    z-index: 1000;
  }
</style>
```

### `position: sticky`

```html
<div style="height: 200px; background: #eee;">Scroll down</div>
<div class="sticky-element">
  I will stick to the top when scrolled past!
</div>
<div style="height: 1000px; background: #ccc;">More content</div>

<style>
  .sticky-element {
    position: sticky;
    top: 0; /* Required for sticky to work */
    background-color: #f8d7da;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #dc3545;
    text-align: center;
    z-index: 999;
  }
</style>
```
