# 25. Frontend Best Practices for Docker

## Quick Revision

Dockerizing frontend applications requires specific best practices to ensure optimal performance, small image sizes, and efficient development workflows. These practices leverage Docker's features to create robust and maintainable containerized frontend deployments.

Key practices include:

*   **Multi-stage builds:** Essential for small production images.
*   **Lightweight base images:** Use `alpine` variants.
*   **`.dockerignore`:** Exclude unnecessary files from the build context.
*   **Efficient caching:** Order `Dockerfile` instructions to maximize layer reuse.
*   **Serving static assets:** Use a production-ready web server (e.g., Nginx) for static builds.
*   **Development setup:** Use bind mounts for hot-reloading.

## Detailed Explanation

Frontend applications, especially those built with frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular, often involve a build step that generates static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Dockerizing these applications effectively means optimizing this process for both development and production.

### 1. Multi-Stage Builds

This is the most critical best practice for frontend applications. (See question 4 for a detailed explanation).

*   **Builder Stage:** Use a Node.js image to install dependencies and build your frontend application.
*   **Runner Stage:** Use a lightweight web server image (like Nginx) to serve the static assets generated in the builder stage. This keeps the final image very small.

### 2. Lightweight Base Images

*   Always prefer `alpine` variants of Node.js and Nginx images (e.g., `node:18-alpine`, `nginx:stable-alpine`). These are significantly smaller and more secure than their full-featured counterparts.

### 3. `.dockerignore` File

Create a `.dockerignore` file in your project root to prevent unnecessary files from being copied into the Docker build context. This speeds up builds and reduces image size.

```
# .dockerignore
node_modules
.git
.env
.DS_Store
# Exclude build output if it's generated locally before Docker build
build
dist
```

### 4. Efficient Caching

Structure your `Dockerfile` to maximize Docker's build cache. (See question 8 for a detailed explanation).

*   Copy `package.json` and `yarn.lock` (or `package-lock.json`) before installing dependencies.
*   Combine `RUN` commands where appropriate.

### 5. Serving Static Assets in Production

For production deployments of single-page applications (SPAs) or statically generated sites, it's best to serve the built assets using a dedicated web server like Nginx.

*   **Nginx:** A high-performance web server that is excellent for serving static files. It's lightweight and efficient.
*   **Configuration:** You might need a custom `nginx.conf` to handle routing for SPAs (e.g., redirecting all unknown paths to `index.html`).

### 6. Development Setup with Bind Mounts

For local development, use Docker Compose with bind mounts to enable hot-reloading and live updates. (See question 15 for a detailed explanation).

*   Mount your local source code into the container.
*   Exclude `node_modules` from the bind mount to ensure container-specific dependencies are used.

### 7. Environment Variables

*   Use environment variables for configuration, especially for API endpoints or feature flags that vary between environments.
*   Ensure sensitive variables are not exposed to the client-side.

## Code Example

### `Dockerfile` for a React App (Production Optimized)

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the React application
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile

COPY . .

RUN yarn build

# Stage 2: Serve the static files with Nginx
FROM nginx:stable-alpine AS runner

# Copy the built React app from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy custom Nginx configuration for SPAs (e.g., to handle client-side routing)
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### `nginx.conf` for SPA Routing

```nginx
# nginx.conf
server {
  listen 80;

  location / {
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html index.htm;
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }

  error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;
  location = /50x.html {
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
  }
}
```
