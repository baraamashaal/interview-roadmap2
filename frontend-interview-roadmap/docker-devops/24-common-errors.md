# 24. Common Docker Errors and Troubleshooting

## Quick Revision

Working with Docker can sometimes lead to unexpected errors. Understanding common issues and how to troubleshoot them is essential for efficient development and deployment. Many errors stem from incorrect `Dockerfile` configurations, network issues, or resource limitations.

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. `Error response from daemon: ...`

This is a generic error message indicating a problem with the Docker daemon or the command you're trying to execute.

*   **Cause:** Often due to the Docker daemon not running, insufficient permissions, or a syntax error in the command.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   Check if Docker Desktop (or Docker daemon) is running.
    *   Ensure your user has permissions to run Docker commands (e.g., `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`).
    *   Restart Docker daemon.

### 2. `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?`

*   **Cause:** The Docker daemon is not running or is inaccessible.
*   **Troubleshooting:** Start Docker Desktop or the Docker daemon service.

### 3. `Error: No such image: <image-name>`

*   **Cause:** The specified image does not exist locally or in the configured registries.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   Check for typos in the image name.
    *   Run `docker images` to see available images.
    *   Run `docker pull <image-name>` to download the image.

### 4. `Error: No such container: <container-name>`

*   **Cause:** The specified container does not exist or is not running.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   Check for typos in the container name.
    *   Run `docker ps -a` to see all containers (running and stopped).

### 5. `Port is already allocated` or `Bind for 0.0.0.0:80 failed: port is already allocated`

*   **Cause:** The host port you're trying to map to the container is already in use by another process.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   Change the host port (e.g., `docker run -p 8080:80 ...`).
    *   Identify and stop the process using the port (e.g., `netstat -ano | findstr :80` on Windows, `lsof -i :80` on Linux/macOS).

### 6. `Image not found` or `Cannot locate specified Dockerfile`

*   **Cause:** Docker cannot find the `Dockerfile` or the specified image.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   Ensure the `Dockerfile` is in the current directory or specify its path correctly (`docker build -f /path/to/Dockerfile .`).
    *   Verify the image name and tag.

### 7. Application inside container fails to start

*   **Cause:** Issues with application code, missing dependencies, incorrect environment variables, or wrong `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT`.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   **Check container logs:** `docker logs <container-name>`.
    *   **Run interactively:** `docker run -it --rm my-image bash` (or `sh`) to get a shell inside the container and debug manually.
    *   **Inspect image:** `docker history my-image` to see how layers were built.
    *   **Verify environment variables:** `docker exec <container-name> env`.

### 8. `COPY failed: no such file or directory`

*   **Cause:** The file or directory specified in a `COPY` instruction does not exist in the build context.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   Ensure the file/directory exists relative to the `Dockerfile`.
    *   Check your `.dockerignore` file to ensure you're not accidentally ignoring the file.

### 9. Slow Builds

*   **Cause:** Inefficient `Dockerfile` caching, large build context, or unnecessary steps.
*   **Troubleshooting:**
    *   **Optimize `Dockerfile` caching:** Order instructions from least to most frequently changing. (See question 8).
    *   **Use `.dockerignore`:** Exclude unnecessary files from the build context.
    *   **Multi-stage builds:** Reduce the final image size and build time. (See question 4).

## Tools for Troubleshooting

*   **`docker logs`:** For viewing container output.
*   **`docker inspect`:** For detailed information about images and containers.
*   **`docker exec`:** For running commands inside a running container.
*   **`docker history`:** For viewing image layers.
*   **`docker system prune`:** For cleaning up unused Docker resources.
