# 1. What is Docker?

## Quick Revision

**Docker** is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using **containers**. Containers are lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.

## Detailed Explanation

Before Docker, developers often faced the problem of "it works on my machine." This meant that an application might run perfectly on a developer's computer but fail when deployed to a different environment (e.g., testing, production) due to differences in operating systems, libraries, or configurations.

Docker solves this problem by providing a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into isolated units called containers.

### Key Concepts

1.  **Container:** A lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application. Containers share the host OS kernel but run in isolated user spaces.

2.  **Image:** A read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. It contains the application code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration. Images are built from a `Dockerfile`.

3.  **Dockerfile:** A text file that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. It defines the environment, dependencies, and commands to run the application.

4.  **Docker Engine:** The core Docker technology that creates and runs containers. It consists of a Docker daemon (server), a REST API, and a CLI (client).

5.  **Docker Hub:** A cloud-based registry service that allows you to find and share Docker images.

### How Docker Works

*   **Build:** You write a `Dockerfile` that specifies how to build your application's image. The Docker Engine reads this `Dockerfile` and builds an image.
*   **Ship:** You can push your Docker image to a registry (like Docker Hub) or share it with others.
*   **Run:** Anyone with Docker installed can pull your image and run it as a container. The container will run your application in the exact same environment as it was built.

### Benefits of Docker

*   **Consistency:** Ensures that your application runs the same way in all environments.
*   **Isolation:** Containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, preventing conflicts.
*   **Portability:** Containers can run on any system that has Docker installed.
*   **Efficiency:** Containers are lightweight and start quickly.
*   **Scalability:** Easily scale your application by running multiple containers.
*   **Faster Development Cycles:** Developers can quickly set up consistent development environments.

## Code Example (Simple Dockerfile for a Frontend App)

```dockerfile
# Use a Node.js base image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and yarn.lock to install dependencies
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./

# Install dependencies
RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile

# Copy the rest of your application code
COPY . .

# Build the React application (if it's a CRA app, for example)
# For Next.js, this would be `RUN yarn build`
RUN yarn build

# Expose the port your application runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["yarn", "start"]
```

**To build and run this Dockerfile:**

1.  Save the above content as `Dockerfile` in your project root.
2.  Build the image: `docker build -t my-frontend-app .`
3.  Run the container: `docker run -p 3000:3000 my-frontend-app`
