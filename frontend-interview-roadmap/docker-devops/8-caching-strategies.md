# 8. Caching Strategies in Docker Builds

## Quick Revision

**Caching strategies** in Docker builds are crucial for speeding up the image build process. Docker builds images layer by layer, and each instruction in a `Dockerfile` creates a new layer. If a layer hasn't changed, Docker can reuse it from its cache, avoiding redundant work.

Effective caching involves structuring your `Dockerfile` to maximize layer reuse, especially for steps that are expensive or change infrequently.

## Detailed Explanation

Docker builds images by executing instructions in a `Dockerfile` sequentially. Each instruction (`FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`, etc.) creates a new layer. Docker maintains a cache of these layers. When it encounters an instruction, it first checks if it has a cached layer that matches the instruction and its context.

### How Docker Caching Works

*   **Instruction Match:** Docker compares the current instruction with the instructions in the parent image's layers. If they match, it reuses the cached layer.
*   **Context Change:** For `COPY` and `ADD` instructions, Docker also checks the checksum of the files being copied. If the files have changed, the cache is invalidated from that point onwards.

### Strategies to Maximize Cache Hit

1.  **Order Instructions from Least to Most Frequently Changing:**
    *   Place instructions that change infrequently (e.g., `FROM`, `WORKDIR`) at the top of the `Dockerfile`.
    *   Place instructions that change more frequently (e.g., `COPY . .` for application code) towards the bottom.

2.  **Separate `COPY` for `package.json` and `node_modules`:**
    *   Copy `package.json` (and `yarn.lock`/`package-lock.json`) first, then run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
    *   This ensures that `node_modules` are only reinstalled if your dependencies (`package.json`) actually change, not every time your application code changes.

3.  **Use Specific Versions for Base Images:**
    *   Always use specific tags (e.g., `node:18-alpine`) instead of `latest` to ensure consistent builds and better cache utilization.

4.  **Leverage Multi-Stage Builds:**
    *   As discussed in question 4, multi-stage builds allow you to separate build-time dependencies from runtime dependencies, leading to smaller images and better cache management.

## Code Example

### Optimized Dockerfile for a Frontend Application

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Builder
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and lock files first to leverage Docker cache
# This layer only invalidates if dependencies change
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./

# Install dependencies
# This layer only invalidates if package.json or lock files change
RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile

# Copy the rest of the application code
# This layer invalidates if any application code changes
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN yarn build

# Stage 2: Runner
FROM nginx:stable-alpine AS runner

# Copy only the build artifacts from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

**Explanation of Caching:**

*   If `package.json` and `yarn.lock` haven't changed, Docker will reuse the cached layers for `COPY package.json ...` and `RUN yarn install ...`.
*   Only when your actual application code changes will the `COPY . .` instruction invalidate the cache, and subsequent layers will be rebuilt.
